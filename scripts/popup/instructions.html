			~*~{ TINT TIMER INSTRUCTIONS }~*~<br><br>
		
		This Chrome Extension is designed to be a 
		productivity assistant that helps you focus
		by tinting the screen of the chrome browser.
		<br><br>
		We were inspired by the Pomodoro Study Method, which
		breaks study sessions into 25 minute intervals with 
		short breaks inbetween. This extension allows 
		sessions of time to be associated with a color tint on 
		the screen. This allows the user to pyschologically 
		associate certain colors with certain tasks, and plan
		out their day more effectively.This color tint will 
		serve as an active reminder to focus on the current task.
		<br>
		<br>
		Features:

		Create different sessions, each with individual
		colors and names. Once started, your sessions will
		activate, tinting your screen and beginning the
		countdown until your sessions end. Pausing will
		remove the tint and stop the timer until you resume
		your session. At the top there is an ETA that will 
		tell you when all your sessions will finish.
